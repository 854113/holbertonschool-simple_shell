# üêö Holberton Shell (hsh)

This repository contains the implementation of **hsh (Holberton Simple Shell)**.  
It is a basic **command line interpreter** written in C, designed to reproduce some of the behavior of shells like `bash` or `sh`.

---

## üìñ Description

First of all, the program checks if the user runs the shell in interactive mode or not.

- If not interactive, `hsh` will execute the command only once and then exit.
- If interactive, a prompt will be displayed (#cisfun$ ) and hsh will wait for the user to enter a command. Once the command finishes executing, the prompt will show up again.

The shell also manages border cases such as:

- `Ctrl+D` (EOF)
- Empty input lines `(\n)`

It supports:

- Commands with arguments
- Absolute or relative paths (e.g., `/bin/ls`)
- If the command is not written with a path, `hsh` will search for it across all the directories defined in the PATH environment variable.
