# 🐚 Holberton Shell (hsh)

This repository contains the implementation of **hsh (Holberton Shell)**.  
It is a basic **command line interpreter** written in C, designed to reproduce some of the behavior of shells like `bash` or `sh`.

---

## 📖 Description

- The shell works in both **interactive** and **non-interactive** mode:
  - **Interactive mode**: displays a prompt (`#cisfun$ `) and waits for user input.  
  - **Non-interactive mode**: executes commands provided through a pipeline or a script.
- After each command is executed, the prompt is displayed again (interactive mode).
- Handles special cases such as:
  - `Ctrl+D` (EOF) to exit the shell.
  - Empty lines or input with only spaces.
- Supports **commands with arguments**.
- Supports commands entered with:
  - **Absolute/relative path** (`/bin/ls`)
  - **PATH resolution** (`ls`)
- Built-in commands:
  - `exit` → exits the shell, returning the last command’s status.
